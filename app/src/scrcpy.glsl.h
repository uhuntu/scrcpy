                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_ourTexture = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader simple = sg_make_shader(simple_shader_desc());

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':
